CYK Algorithm Implementation
Overview

This project implements the Cocke–Younger–Kasami (CYK) Algorithm — a dynamic programming approach used to determine whether a given string can be generated by a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).

The program reads grammar rules and an input string, then applies the CYK algorithm to verify if the string belongs to the language defined by the grammar. If valid, it also displays a table showing which non-terminals generate different substrings.

Description

The CYK Algorithm is a bottom-up parser used in computational linguistics and compiler design.
It checks if a string can be derived from a given CFG by progressively building possible non-terminals for substrings of increasing length.

This Python implementation:

Reads grammar rules in CNF form.

Accepts an input string.

Uses dynamic programming to fill the CYK parsing table.

Determines whether the start symbol (S) can generate the full string.

Input Format

First Line: Number of grammar rules.

Next Lines: Grammar rules in the format A -> BC or A -> a

Terminals: Lowercase letters (e.g., a, b, c)

Non-terminals: Uppercase letters (e.g., S, A, B)

Last Line: Input string (sequence of terminals)

Output Format

If the input string can be generated by the grammar:

YES


Followed by a CYK table showing which non-terminals can derive each substring.

If the input string cannot be generated:

NO

Example

Input:

5
S -> AB
A -> a
B -> BC
B -> b
C -> c
abc


Output:

YES
--- CYK Table ---
a : A | b : B | c : C |
ab : S | bc : B |
abc : S |

Dependencies

Python 3.x (no external libraries required)
